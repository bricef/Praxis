; ========================================

; Exercise 2.44.  Define the procedure up-split used by corner-split. 
; It is similar to right-split, except that it switches the roles of 
; below and beside.

(define (up-split painter n)
	(if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
        (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))

(let* (
	(image (mkimage 600 600))
	(canvas (get-canvas image)))
	(begin 
		((right-split rogers 4) canvas)
		(save-image image "test.png")
		(prn "")))
