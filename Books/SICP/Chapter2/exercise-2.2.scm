(title "Exercise 2.2")
; Exercise 2.2:
;
; Consider the problem of representing line segments
; in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair
; of points: a starting point and an ending point.
; Define a constructor make-segment and selectors
; start-segment and end-segment that define the
; representation of segments in terms of points.
;
; Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair
; of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate.
;
; Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
; selectors x-point and y-point that define this
; representation.
;
; Finally, using your selectors and constructors,
; define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a
; line segment as argument and returns its midpoint
; (the point whose coordinates are the average of the
; coordinates of the endpoints). To try your procedures,
; youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

(define (string-point p)
	(format "(~a,~a)" (x-point p) (y-point p)))

(define (print-point p)
	(display (string-point p))
	(newline))

(define (make-point x y)
	(cons x y))

(define (x-point p)
	(car p))

(define (y-point p)
	(cdr p))

(assert "Points are represented as expected"
	(equal? "(0.3,9.0)" (string-point (make-point 0.3 9.0))))

(define (make-segment p1 p2)
	(cons p1 p2))

(define (start-segment s)
	(car s))

(define (end-segment s)
	(cdr s))

(define (midpoint-segment s)
	(midpoint (start-segment s) (end-segment s)))

(define (midpoint p1 p2)
	(make-point
		(average (x-point p1) (x-point p2))
		(average (y-point p1) (y-point p2))))

(assert "Midpoint segment works as expected"
	(equal?
		(make-point 5 5)
		(midpoint-segment
			(make-segment
				(make-point 0 0)
				(make-point 10 10)))))
