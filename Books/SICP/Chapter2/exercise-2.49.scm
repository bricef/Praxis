; Exercise 2.49:
; Use segments->painter to define the following
; primitive painters:
;
;  a. The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.
;  b. The painter that draws an “X” by connecting opposite
;     corners of the frame.
;  c. The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the
;     midpoints of the sides of the frame.
;  d. The wave painter.
