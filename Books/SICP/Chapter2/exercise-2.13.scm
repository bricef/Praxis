	Take interval A between A1 and A2, where tolerance of A Ta = 0.5 * (A2 - A1) and center of A is A0
	Take interval B between B1 and B2, where tolerance of B Tb = 0.5 * (B2 - B1) and center of B is B0

	So A*B will be 

	AB = (B0-Tb)*(A0-Ta) -> (B0+Tb)*(A0+Ta)

	So that center of AB Cab is:

	Cab = 0.5 * [ (B0+Tb)*(A0+Ta) - (B0-Tb)*(A0-Ta) ]

	So that Tab is:

	Tab = 0.5 * [ (B0+Tb)(A0+Ta) - (B0-Tb)(A0-Ta) ]


	And the fractional tolerance of AB T% is

	T% = Tab / Cab

	T% = 
		 0.5 * [ (B0+Tb)(A0+Ta) - (B0-Tb)(A0-Ta) ]
		 -----------------------------------------
		 0.5 * [ (B0+Tb)(A0+Ta) - (B0-Tb)(A0-Ta) ]

	Which reduces to:

	T% = 
		 TbA0 + TaB0
		 -----------
		 B0A0 + TaTb

	But TaTb << B0A0 

	Therefore B0A0 + TaTb â‰ˆ B0A0

	So:

	T% = 
		 Tb + Ta
		 --   --
		 B0   A0

	Ie: The fractional tolerance of the product is the sum of the fractional tolerance of the operands
