(title "Exercise 2.6")

; Exercise 2.6:
;
; In case representing pairs as procedures wasn’t
; mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a language
; that can manipulate procedures, we can get by
; without numbers (at least insofar as nonnegative
; integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the
; operation of adding 1 as:

(define zero
	(lambda (f)
		(lambda (x) x)))

(define (add-1 n)
	(lambda (f)
		(lambda (x)
			(f ((n f) x)))))

; This representation is known as Church numerals,
; after its inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who
; invented the λ-calculus.
;
; Define one and two directly (not in terms of zero
; and add-1).
;
; Hint: Use substitution to evaluate (add-1 zero).
;
; Give a direct definition of the addition procedure +
; (not in terms of repeated application of add-1).
