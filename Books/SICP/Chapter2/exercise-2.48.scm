; Exercise 2.48:
; A directed line segment in the plane can be
; represented as a pair of vectorsâ€”the vector
; running from the origin to the start-point
; of the segment, and the vector running from
; the origin to the end-point of the segment.
; Use your vector representation from
; Exercise 2.46 to de- fine a representation
; for segments with a constructor make-segment
; and selectors start-segment and end-segment.
