;   Exercise 2.68
;   =============
;
;   The encode procedure takes as arguments a message and a tree and
;   produces the list of bits that gives the encoded message.
;
   (define (encode message tree)
     (if (null? message)
         '()
         (append (encode-symbol (car message) tree)
                 (encode (cdr message) tree))))
;
;   Encode-symbol is a procedure, which you must write, that returns the
;   list of bits that encodes a given symbol according to a given tree.  You
;   should design encode-symbol so that it signals an error if the symbol is
;   not in the tree at all.  Test your procedure by encoding the result you
;   obtained in exercise [2.67] with the sample tree and seeing whether it
;   is the same as the original sample message.
