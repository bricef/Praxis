;   Exercise 2.57
;   =============
;
;   Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of
;   arbitrary numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above
;   could be expressed as
;
;   (deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
;
;   Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums and
;   products, without changing the deriv procedure at all.  For example, the
;   addend of a sum would be the first term, and the augend would be the sum
;   of the rest of the terms.
